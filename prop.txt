Can an n-gram analysis of the top most used, non-stop words in an Amazon product's reviews predict how much higher its sales rank will be than its peers? This information could help marketers better phrase their advertising copy. Though books are not as well-used of a medium today, perhaps they provide a much more stable measurement of the semantic zeitgeist than social media, having been edited heavily for publication. To judge the popularity of a word, I will look at the percent change of its unigram from the previous to the target year. Due to my lack of computing power and space, I have only looked at the first most used, non-stop word in the review corpus. If I had the resources, I might apply tf-idf to the words in question, not depending solely upon frequency. Lastly, I only used the publicly available APIs for both the review data and ngram analysis. Large dumps of both of these are available at http://jmcauley.ucsd.edu/data/amazon/ and http://storage.googleapis.com/books/ngrams/books/datasetsv2.html.

var combinedText1 = "I just received this shaver and found it to be the best electric shave I've ever had! Some history. I've shaved with a Norelco rotary for years. When the last one died and considering the cost of replacement heads I went to a Braun foil. I don't recall the model but it wasn't the cheapest or the most expensive. I gave it a full month and it was still - awful. I had to shave for 15 minutes and still wasn't happy, not to mention when shaving near the ears I nearly went deaf. I cleaned it up and gave it to my son. I ordered this one based on the wet/dry capabilities. Face prep? None. I just put on some shaving cream and in two or three minutes - smooth face. I guess it depends on your beard but my neck is always a problem area but this Panasonic did the trick. Cleaning was a breeze, charging seems very quick and not deafening. I am very pleased to say the least and actually don't dread shaving. For someone who has never used a wet/dry shaver it's an odd sensation at first - like you're just moving shave cream around and not really shaving - until you run your hand over the finished process. I can't see me using any other method now and if it endures, I'll come back to Panasonic! I bought this product (as a female) to shave my legs and underarms. My husband has a triple head wet/dry razor and loves it, but it tore up my underarm skin and didn't give me a close shave on my legs. This razor does the trick!!! I use it on my dry legs and love the close shave. I use it wet on my underarms and it works great too!!! It was worth all the research. There aren't too many reviews by women for a man's razor. I've tried all levels of Panasonic shavers over the last few years. Some were really pricey and had a lot of features. Some were really basic. All were very high quality. I found, however, that I use them all the same way, regardless of what I paid for them and what features they had. I wash my face, I apply shaving foam and I shave. Afterwords, I take the head off the shaver and turn the sink water on high and rinse the head off, give it a shake and dry it on a towel. Every week to ten days, I recharge it. I didn't use the automatic cleaning station for long on the shaver that featured it. Way too much trouble and expense buying those washer cartridges. I never seemed to have a new cartridge when I needed it anyway. I got the same result just rinsing the heads with water after shaving. Same with the flexible head feature. I never seemed to get a close shave when I left the head loose to move, so I always locked the head down so it wouldn't move. I feel that I get a great shave with this basic shaver and I have the added benefit of not paying extra for features I will never use.";

var combinedText2 = "I've always been a Remington user for many years. Over a year ago I did go to using a regular 3-blade razor because of a skin condition I have but I never liked using a razor and it didn't shave as well as the rotary Remington, and I've tried many types of razors. Anyway, when I saw that the new rotary electric shavers can be washed to keep them clean, I went back to it and got the R4. It was CLEAR that the new rotary Remington shavers are a ton better than the ones designed years ago. The R4 really gets close and does't pull at all for me. It does a better job than any regular edge razor I've used. I'm not going to wash it daily, but about once a month I'll do a washing of the blades then lube them again. The swivel and flex heads do make a difference in getting a better shave over the curved areas of the face. It's no gimmick. When I shave I use a magnified mirror so I can see the difference the R4 makes over the regular razor and the old design rotary Remington. This is not a long term use review, but just a fast one on the R4's first uses. I hope it lasts and keeps doing the great job it's doing. It has a 60 day money back guarantee with is nice. If you don't like it, return it. I like it. I was very tired of using razors so i finally decided to invest in one of these, great for travel and shaving in a pinch as well as daily use. Battery lasts forever, and compared to similar products i've used, this is quieter, doesn't tug as bad, shaves cleaner, and is just better in general. Very comfortable in the hand and on the face, worth every penny. Rechargeable electric razors by their nature will always have one advantage over blades: they can be used anywhere, anytime, because they don't require a water supply and shaving cream. Therefore, the only question in evaluating electric razors is whether their disadvantages outweigh that one main advantage. Closeness of the shave: tested this Remington circular head electric shaver vs. a nearly new Remington F4790 foil electric shaver (that I had reviewed earlier): I shaved half my face with one model and the other half with the other model. I detected no difference in the closeness of the shave. That said, neither gave as smooth a shave as a disposable blade, and shaving with a blade takes far less time. The trimmer: Both the circular head model and the foil model have pop-up trimmers. The trimmer on the circular head model was far superior to that on the foil model for trimming my mustache: the circular head model did an excellent job. That is because the circular head trimmer pops-out perpendicular to the shaver's body, rather than parallel to the shaver's body: the perpendicular orientation makes it far easier to see what I was trimming and control the cut. On the other hand, the circular head model did not do as well on sideburns. The trimmer on the foil model cut long hairs more easily than the trimmer on the circular model. Close inspection reveals why. The trimmer on the";

var combinedText3 = "I'm a long-time Braun user (currently I'm using a Series 5 550cc), but I'll be first to admit some of their models have problems. Their latest battery-powered travel shaver, the MobileShave M60B, is a definite improvement over my old PocketGo P-70. The main change, other than color and lack of the little push-out trimmer, is the newer Design Smart Foil like many of the more expensive Series shavers. The Smart Foil makes a tremendous difference compared to the older-style foil. The MobileShave gives a surprisingly good shave, but like most Braun single-foil shavers it will miss some longer hairs on your neck. This shaver can be used wet, and I actually like using it with shave gel (Nivea for Men Q10 is my favorite)which I think gives a closer shave with no irritation. Plus MobileShave can be washed clean and even used in the shower if you like that option. Battery life (two Duracell AAs are included) is excellent. All in all, this is a fine low-cost shaver and it's well worth keeping in your messenger bag or brief case for touch ups, and it is a nice compact package (with on-board storage for a cleaning brush) for travel. Well done. I was very surprised at how well this thing works given its very low price. Instead of using the provided alkaline batteries, I installed a pair of recently charged 2300mAh NiMh rechargeable batteries. Using it every day, those batteries lasted for well over a month without requiring a recharge - and these were not quicky shaves. It can shave very close, and it glides easily over my skin.For more detailed evaluation, let me compare to a Panasonic 3 head rechargeable shaver I have. Actually, its the 3rd such I have had over many years. The failure mode has always been in battery performance. Servicing the built in batteries is not economically feasible, since replacing the whole unit also buys you new heads. Even my most recent is down to 2 shaves per charge, so I was pondering a replacement when I ran across this extraordinarily inexpensive Braun. The very low price was surprising since Braun has a good reputation. The fact that the Braun's batteries were user-replaceable was a strong selling point for me. Nevertheless, at the low price I was not expecting much.The Braun shaves closer than my Panasonic, and it glides more smoothly over my skin. The Braun is not nearly as loud, which is relevant since I normally shave while watching TV. Battery life is very good and replacing them is easy. Because its head is smaller, it takes somewhat longer to shave with the Braun; but I really don't care about that, since I am watching TV at the same time anyway. There is one significant con: There are non-whisker hairs (softer, lying close to the skin) in a couple areas near my beard which I also wish to shave. Unfortunately, these hairs never seem to poke through the Braun's foil, no matter how I maneuver it. Every 4 or 5 days, I have to resort to another means (the Panasonic or a blade) to get those hairs. The Panasonic has no problem with the soft hairs, since one of its 3 heads is a slotted head. (Norelco heads are also slotted and will also get these hairs.)Although these devices claim to be washable, I would not recommend washing. It is nice to know that the works are well sealed, but wetting it still seem like asking for trouble. For decades, I have used talcum powder as a lubricant for shaving. The drier the skin and whiskers the better. (IMO, the idea of wet shaving with an electric shaver is very counterproductive, since, unlike the situation with a conventional blade, softening the beard does not make cutting it any easier for an electric shaver mechanism (which has more of a scissor like action). Indeed, softening the beard just decreases the probability that any given hair will get to where a blade can hit it.) Talcum powder that collects inside is easily knocked loose and/or blown from the internal blade parts and skin oils and bits go with it. Once a week or so, it is good to use the brush for any buildup that might occur (e.g., between the blades of the shaving block). This approach requires very minimal maintenance and does not lead to any problems that I have ever experienced.If I were still dating, I would keep one of these in my car for last minute touch-ups. The Braun M60B shaver is an excellent device. I long ago gave up on using disc head shavers and double or triple foils on my sparse beard. I used my favored Braun 5523 pocket shaver for 10 years before the plastic housing cracked. The Braun M60B is essentially the same device with added features of twist cap (never detaches so it can't be lost), new geometric pattern foil, and washability; all improvements. In truth, I do not know if my old device was water resistant and never tried.The foil is extremely comfortable and doesn't give razor burn when you apply pressure like the old one did. I can press this shaver firmly against my skin for closer shave with no discomfort at all! The shaver itself does a nice job. It's actually closer than a blade on my moustache. Not as close as a blade on my cheeks and neck, but perfectly acceptable, and better than any other electric shaver I've ever used.";
